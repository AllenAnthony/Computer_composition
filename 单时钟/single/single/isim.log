ERROR: at 1300 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "C:/Users/asus/Desktop/single/single/alu32.v" Line 51. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
